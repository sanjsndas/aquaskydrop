            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-cool-slate-gray mb-4 mt-4">Informal Negotiations</h3>
            <p class="text-cool-slate-gray leading-relaxed text-justify mb-4">
                To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the âDisputesâ) brought by either you or us (individually, a âPartyâ and collectively, the âPartiesâ), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-cool-slate-gray mb-4 mt-4">Binding Arbitration</h3>
            <p class="text-cool-slate-gray leading-relaxed text-justify mb-4">
                If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website: <a href="http://www.adr.org" class="text-skydrop-blue hover:underline">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [Your Company's City, Your Company's State/Region].
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-cool-slate-gray mb-4 mt-4">Restrictions</h3>
            <p class="text-cool-slate-gray leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
                The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
            </p>
