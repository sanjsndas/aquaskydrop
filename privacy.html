            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-cool-slate-gray mb-6 mt-8">5. Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p class="text-cool-slate-gray leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
                We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
            </p>

            <p class="text-cool-slate-gray leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
                We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-cool-slate-gray mb-6 mt-8">7. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p class="text-cool-slate-gray leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
                Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction. If you are located outside [Your Company's Country] and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including personal data, to [Your Company's Country] and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. AquaSkyDrop will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your personal data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-cool-slate-gray mb-6 mt-8">8. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (for GDPR users)</h2>
            <p class="text-cool-slate-gray leading-relaxed text-justify mb-4">
                If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-cool-slate-gray mb-6 mt-8">9. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
            <p class="text-cool-slate-gray leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-cool-slate-gray mb-6 mt-8">10. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
