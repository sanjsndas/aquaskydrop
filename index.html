                <p>The information provided on this Aquafiname website is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice. While we strive to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the content, including details about our rainwater harvesting systems, smart monitoring solutions, and sustainability insights, Aquafiname makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability with respect to the website or the information, products, services, or related graphics contained on the website for any purpose. Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk. It is imperative that users conduct their own due diligence and seek professional advice tailored to their specific circumstances before making any decisions or taking any actions based on the information presented herein.</p>

                <p>Rainwater harvesting system performance, water savings, and environmental benefits are highly variable and depend on numerous factors, including but not limited to, local rainfall patterns, roof area and type, system design and capacity, water usage habits, climate conditions, and proper maintenance. The estimates and projections provided on this website, such as those from the "Water Savings Calculator" or "Sustainability Impact Tracker," are illustrative and based on generalized assumptions. Actual results may differ significantly. Aquafiname does not guarantee specific water savings, financial returns, or environmental outcomes. Users should consult with qualified professionals, including hydrologists, engineers, and local building authorities, to obtain precise assessments and ensure compliance with all applicable local, regional, and national regulations, codes, and permitting requirements. Our systems are designed to meet certain standards, but local variations in regulations can be substantial and are the responsibility of the system owner to verify and adhere to.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the use of harvested rainwater for specific purposes may be subject to health and safety regulations. While Aquafiname systems incorporate filtration and purification technologies, the suitability of harvested rainwater for potable (drinking) or other sensitive uses depends on the system's design, maintenance, and additional treatment methods that may be required by local health authorities. Aquafiname explicitly states that, unless otherwise specified and certified for potable use in accordance with all relevant local regulations, our systems are primarily designed for non-potable applications (e.g., irrigation, toilet flushing, laundry, car washing). Users are solely responsible for ensuring that the harvested water is safe and appropriate for its intended use and for implementing any additional treatment or testing as required by law or best practice. Aquafiname disclaims all liability for any health issues or damages arising from the improper use or treatment of harvested rainwater.</p>
